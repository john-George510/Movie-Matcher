# Movie Matcher
Movie Matcher is a project that takes in a video clip and uses facial recognition technology to determine the movie it's from. The project uses Django as a backend and ElectronJS as a frontend. The facial recognition model is built using the dlib and OpenCV libraries.

## How it Works ?
The user uploads a video clip to the Movie Matcher website. The website then uses the facial recognition model to analyze the clip and compare it to a database of known movies. The website returns the name of the movie if it's a match, or informs the user that the clip couldn't be matched.
